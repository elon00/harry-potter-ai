## 1. Abstract
Harry Potter AI ($POTTER) introduces a zero-trust, post-quantum resilient Web4 protocol designed specifically for Arbitrum Stylus (EVM L2). By combining deterministic 64-bit Conway cellular automata invariants with native smart contract execution, Harry Potter AI provides absolute mathematical state guarantees, fail-closed solvency boundaries, and sub-second payment settlement.

## 2. Mathematical Specification & Conway Invariants
Let S_t in [0, 1]^64 denote the 64-bit state vector at discrete cycle t. The non-linear automaton state update rule is formalized as:
S_(t+1)[i] = f(S_t[i-1], S_t[i], S_t[i+1])
Where f preserves deterministic neighborhood conservation rules. The state integrity checksum C_t satisfies:
C_t = XOR_(k=0...t) H(S_k || k)
Where H is a cryptographically secure hash function.
